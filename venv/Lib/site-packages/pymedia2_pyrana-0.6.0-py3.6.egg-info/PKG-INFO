Description: Pyrana is a pure-python package which provides easy, pythonic and
        powerful handling of multimedia files.
        
        -  easy: pyrana does not submerge you with tons of options and details,
           but is filled with sane defaults. pyrana aims to be multimedia
           processing what
           `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_ is for http.
        
        -  pythonic: pyrana wants to play nice and work well with the other
           well-established relevant python packages:
           `Pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow>`_,
           `pygame <http://pygame.org>`_,
           `PySDL2 <http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_,
           `PyAudio <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>`_,
           `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ compatibility is coming soon.
        
        -  powerful: pyrana provides an independent API, but is built on the
           great foundations provided by the `powerful FFMpeg
           libraries <http://ffmpeg.org>`_.
        
        pyrana is a modern, pure python package which is developed for python 3
        and compatible with python 2.7, which takes great
        advantage of `CFFI <http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.7/>`_, so
        the compatibility with `pypy <http://pypy.org>`_ is just one step away.
        
        pyrana offers a minimum 100% unit-test and documentation coverage, and
        put great emphasis on small, yet complete and workable examples. Last
        but not least, pyrana is released under the very liberal ZLIB license.
